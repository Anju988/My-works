# My-works
Ported a PyTorch-based Iris flower classification Python program to C++ using libtorch. Configured the development environment to include libtorch headers and link against libtorch libraries. Utilized the Iris dataset for training and testing the model. Evaluated the performance of the Iris classification model.
